# ☁️ Cloud Resume Challenge – Azure Edition

This project is my implementation of the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) using **Azure**, **GitHub Actions**, ****Claude**,  and **Azure Blob Storage** for static site hosting. I have always wanted to explore more front end development too! Probably spent way too much time iterating on features but hey, I am learning a lot! 

## Live Site
slater.cloud

##  What I Built

- HTML/CSS static resume page
-  Hosted using **Azure Blob Storage**
- GitHub Actions pipeline for CI/CD
- Secured access using **Storage Account Key**
- Infrastructure configured using Azure CLI
- In progress: visitor counter using Azure Functions + Cosmos DB

##  Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, TAILWIND 
- **Cloud**: Azure Storage (Static Website, Blob Storage for Dev Journal)
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions, 
- **Tools**: Azure CLI, PowerShell, nano
